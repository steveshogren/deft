# deft

A Clojure library that provides basic runtime typeshape checking.

The idea of a typeshape is to have functions define what "shape" of maps it needs as its parameters and return value. This will allow for better doc-strings, which expand after each parameter notifiying you of what the expected "signatures" are.

Deft lets you define a new kind of Clojure function, one that checks the "shape" of the parameters and the return values. It only checks maps for keys, since that is a common pain point in our code. Let's jump to some examples.

```clojure
;; define some simple "typeshapes" (they are just vecs)
(def Account [:id :balance])
(def Pay [:amount])

;; define a deft function: checks the two parameters and the return 
(deft adds [account Account pay Pay] Account
    (assoc account :balance (+ (:amount pay) (:balance account))))

(adds {:balance 2 :id 1} {:amount 2})
;; => {:balance 4 :id 1}
(adds 1 1)
;; => Exception Passed an invalid 'typeshape'

```

That wasn't so bad, it simply gives you some handy verification of the in's and out's of the function. But what about a more flexible partial usage?

```clojure
;; a [] prevents all checks
(deft noTypes [num [] account [:balance]] []
  (+ num (:balance account)))
(noTypes 1 {:balance 1})
;; => 2

```

Since the definition of a typeshape is just a vec of keywords (or a Record), it is easy to "turn off" checking for any parameter or return value by using an empty vec. Additionally, you do not have to import a namespace just to get at a "typeshape", you can just simply redefine it inline, like the account above.


```clojure
;; Destructuring still works.
(def Coord [:x :y])
(deft addX [pos Coord {x :x} Coord] Coord 
  (assoc pos :x (+ x (:x pos))))

(addX {:x 1 :y 100} {:x 1 :y 100})
;; => {:y 100 :x 2}


;; Passing in a larger map than needed is fine too.
(deft adds [f [] s [:num]] []
  (+ f (:num s)))
(adds 1 {:num 1 :date 2 :id 4})
;; => 2


;; A record is a valid typeshape
(defrecord Person [name])
(deft get-name [p Person] [] (:name p))
(get-name (Person. "t"))
;; => "t"
(get-name 1)
;; => Exception Passed an invalid 'typeshape'


;; All the original defn parameters should be supported
(deft pre-post "Test" {:horse "test"}
  ([num Num] Num
     {:pre [(pos? (:val num))]}
     (goofy-add num {:val 0}))
  ([num1 Num num2 Num] Num
     {:pre [(pos? (:val num2))] :post [(< 2 (:val %))]}
     (assoc num1 :val (+ (:val num1) (:val num2)))))

(pre-post {:val 0}) ;; => AssertionError
(pre-post {:val 1} {:val 1}) ;; => AssertionError
(pre-post {:val 1} {:val 0}) ;; => AssertionError
(pre-post {:val 1} {:val 2} ;; => {:val 3}



```

## Todo

* -Allow for multiple function signatures-
* -Enable use of attr-map? and prepost-map?-
* Allow syntax for nested maps, right now they are only flat

## Goals

Clojure already has a fine code contracts system built in, and there is no need to overlap with that. This attempts to eliminate some duplication around checking maps for certain keys.

Pull requests considered promptly!

## "Types? In clojure?! Are you crazy??!"

"No, no, _typeshapes_. Typeshapes are totally different than the normal overpowering types from the strict languages."

"So, what, they still check at compile time?"

"Nah, they only get checked at run-time, like code contracts."

"That probably takes forever to change all your code! I'm too busy for that!"

"Nope, it's totally a la carte, you can change just one function at a time, and you can prevent checking all the parameters."

"Awesome."
